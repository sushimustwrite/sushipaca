I coded something and it didn't break! So I started re-learning to write code again a week ago and this is the first real live tangible result. It's a very short game I wrote that may or may not be #wrimosagainsttheeatingofsushi propaganda. Download the .zip file, run python lpthw36.py, and get going.

Note: If you don't have Python on your computer already (likely the case if you run Windows), then you'll have to get it. Check the Python site or search around since I'm pretty clueless there.

Don't be a dick with this and we're cool, you hear? Fork it, rewrite it, learn from it, I don't care.
